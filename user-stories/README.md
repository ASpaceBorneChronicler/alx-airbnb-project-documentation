\# User Stories



\## Overview



This directory contains the user stories for the Airbnb Clone project. User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system.



The primary purpose of these user stories is to:



\-   \*\*Focus on the end-user's needs\*\* by describing what they want to achieve and why.

&nbsp;   

\-   \*\*Serve as a basis for development and testing\*\* by providing clear, concise descriptions of each feature.

&nbsp;   

\-   \*\*Facilitate communication\*\* between the development team, product managers, and stakeholders.

&nbsp;   



\## User Story Structure



Each user story follows a standard format:



`As a <type of user>, I want to <perform an action>, so that <I get some value or benefit>.`



This structure ensures that every story captures the \*\*who\*\*, \*\*what\*\*, and \*\*why\*\* of a feature.



\## Key User Roles



The user stories are categorized by the primary user roles in the system:



\-   \*\*Guest\*\*: A user who books properties.

&nbsp;   

\-   \*\*Host\*\*: A user who lists properties.

&nbsp;   

\-   \*\*Admin\*\*: A user with administrative privileges to manage the platform.

&nbsp;   

\-   \*\*User\*\*: A general term for either a `Guest` or a `Host`.
